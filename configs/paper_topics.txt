 1. Papers about explanations, including natural language explanations and other forms of explanations.  
 2. Papers making significant contributions in alignment.  
   - Relevant: theoretical and novel empirical algorithms, and papers adopting novel evaluation approaches for alignments.  
   - Not relevant: papers only applying alignment to existing applications.
 3. Shows a significant advance in the understanding of neural network models.
    - Relevant: papers using circuit, probing, attention analysis, subnetwork analysis, information theory and other tools to understand the mechanisms of neural networks.  
    - Not relevant: papers about neural tangent kernel, training dynamics.
 4. Describes new paradigms to evaluating open-ended text generation. Evaluating the outputs of language models is hard, especially in open-ended settings like for chatbots.
    - Relevant: papers that fundamentally rethink language model evaluation -- especially by accounting for subjectivity or using adversaries.
    - Not relevant: specific evaluations for specific tasks, identifying new properties or flaws of language models, or simply collecting new data.
 5. Conducts surveys or provides data into real-world usage and safety properties of language models.
    - Relevant: papers that create new datasets or surveys on real-world usage of language models.
    - Not relevant: papers that apply language models to new real-world tasks.
 6. Studies 'scaling laws' in the context of neural networks. Scaling laws refer to the very clear power-law relationship between the size or computational power used to train a model and the performance of that model.
    - Relevant: theoretical or conceptual explanation behind scaling laws for language models.
    - Not relevant: papers that have experiments at different model scales (but do not explicitly fit a scaling law) or papers that mention scaling laws, but the scaling laws are not the central subject of the paper

 In suggesting papers to your friend, remember that he enjoys papers that are helpful for understanding and controlling AI models, especially natural language processing models.
 Your friend also likes learning about surprising empirical results in language models, as well as clever machine learning tricks.
 He does not want to read papers that are about primarily applications of methods to specific domains.
